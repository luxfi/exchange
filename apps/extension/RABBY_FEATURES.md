# Rabby Features Migration Tracker

This document tracks the migration of features from the Rabby-based xwallet to the Lux Exchange extension.

## Overview

The Lux Exchange extension is built on a modern stack (WXT, React 19, Tamagui) and integrates deeply with the Uniswap/Lux DEX ecosystem. We're augmenting it with battle-tested features from the Rabby wallet fork (xwallet).

## Feature Status

## Architecture Decisions

### Hardware Wallet Integration

The exchange extension uses WXT (Vite-based) which requires different handling than webpack:
- Use offscreen documents for WebHID/USB communication
- Maintain MV3 compatibility with service worker limitations
- Share keyring interfaces with existing wallet package

### State Management

- Extend existing Redux store with new slices for hardware wallets
- Add migrations for schema changes
- Use Redux Saga for async hardware operations

### UI Components

- Build on existing Tamagui component library
- Follow feature-based folder structure
- Integrate with existing navigation system

## Dependencies to Add

```json
{
  "@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth": "^6.x",
  "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb": "^6.x",
  "@trezor/connect-webextension": "^9.x",
  "@keystonehq/keystone-sdk": "^0.x",
  "@walletconnect/web3wallet": "^1.x",
  "@safe-global/safe-core-sdk": "^3.x"
}
```

## Migration Notes

### From xwallet

The xwallet codebase uses:
- Webpack build system
- Class-based services with singleton pattern
- Chrome storage API directly
- Broadcast messaging pattern

We adapt to:
- WXT/Vite build system
- Functional approach with hooks where possible
- Redux persist with webextension storage adapter
- Redux action dispatch pattern

### Testing

- Port relevant tests from xwallet
- Add E2E tests for hardware wallet flows
- Mock hardware wallet devices in tests
