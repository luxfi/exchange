# Lux Exchange

Lux Exchange is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Lux Network, providing automated market making (AMM) functionality for token swaps, liquidity provision, and DeFi operations.

## Overview

The exchange implements a constant product market maker (CPMM) model, similar to Uniswap V2/V3, with optimizations for the Lux Network's high-throughput, low-latency architecture.

### Key Features

- **Automated Market Making**: Constant product formula (x * y = k) for price discovery
- **Liquidity Pools**: Permissionless pool creation and liquidity provision
- **Token Swaps**: Efficient token-to-token swaps with minimal slippage
- **LP Tokens**: ERC-20 compliant liquidity provider tokens
- **Fee Distribution**: Automatic fee collection and distribution to LPs

## Quick Start

### Swapping Tokens

```typescript
import { SwapRouter } from '@luxfi/exchange-sdk'

const router = new SwapRouter(provider, ROUTER_ADDRESS)

// Swap exact tokens for tokens
const tx = await router.swapExactTokensForTokens(
  amountIn,
  amountOutMin,
  [tokenA, tokenB],
  recipient,
  deadline
)
```

### Adding Liquidity

```typescript
import { LiquidityPool } from '@luxfi/exchange-sdk'

const pool = new LiquidityPool(provider, POOL_ADDRESS)

// Add liquidity to a pool
const tx = await pool.addLiquidity(
  tokenAAmount,
  tokenBAmount,
  minTokenA,
  minTokenB,
  recipient,
  deadline
)
```
